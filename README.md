# MyReads Project

MyReads is a React web-based App that helps you to organize your reading, by making you able to divide your books into :
    - Currently Reading
    - Want to Read
    - Read
also, you can add a new book to your library by searching for the book title. Each book that is not on your library classified as 'none', which makes able to remove any book by selecting 'none'.


## Instructions for Setup

* clone project file using `git clone `
* acces project directory with `cd `
* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install` if you're using `yarn`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

After setup, your browser will automatically open a live version of MyReads.



## Important
The books data of MyReads are fetched from the URL `https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com` in the `src/BooksAPI.js` file, This backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

This project is for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.Therefore, any contributing won't be approved.
